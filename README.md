# C++ Data Structures and Algorithms

### ⚠️ **Caution**
This project is currently a personal project in development and not yet complete. 
Optimization and correctness of implementation are not guaranteed. 
Contributions and redistribution are politely declined until an initial draft is completed.
Thank you for your understanding.

## Introduction
This package provides various data structures and algorithms implemented in C++20 using concepts and modules. 
The interfaces and behaviors of the data structures are referenced from [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) and [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/).

## Features
- **Modern C++**: Utilizes C++20 features including concepts and modules.
- **Comprehensive**: Includes a wide range of data structures and associated algorithms.
- **Modular Design**: Each data structure and algorithm is encapsulated in its own module for easy maintenance and reusability.
- **Detailed Documentation**: Each module directory contains a README file with detailed information on the interface, complexity, and usage of the provided functions.

## Installation
(Installation steps will be added once the CMake build process is implemented.)

## Usage
To use the data structures and algorithms provided by this package, simply import the necessary modules in your C++ code. For example:

```cpp
import array;
import default_value;

int main(){
    j::Array<int, 5> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    return 0;
}
```
